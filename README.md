# Marketo Source ([docs](https://fivetran-dbt-marketo.netlify.app/#!/overview))

This package models Marketo data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/marketo). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/marketo#schema).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:

* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Marketo transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_marketo). The staging models:

* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
  * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
  * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
  * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the user table's ID column is renamed user_id.

## Installation Instructions
`dbt_marketo_source` currently supports `dbt 0.20.x`.

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/marketo_source
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```

## Configuration
By default, this package will look for your Marketo data in the `marketo` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Marketo data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  marketo_source:
    marketo_database: your_database_name
    marketo_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Marketo staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_marketo`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Marketo data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
  marketo_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

### Enabling/Disabling Models
This package takes into consideration tables that may not be synced due to slowness caused by the Marketo API. By default the `campaign` and `program` models are disabled. If you sync these tables, enable the modeling done by adding the following to your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
vars:
    marketo__enable_campaigns:   true      # Enable if Fivetran is syncing the campaign table
    marketo__enable_programs:    true      # Enable if Fivetran is syncing the program table
```

Alternatively, you may need to disable certain models. The below models can be disabled by adding them to your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
vars:
    marketo__activity_delete_lead_enabled:  false     # Disable if you do not have the activity_delete_lead table 
```
